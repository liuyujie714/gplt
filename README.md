# Description

`gplt` is a very convenient python tool for plotting gromacs output file, such as `.xvg`, `.xpm` or convert `.dat` to `.xpm` for visualization. This tool is similar to [DuIvyTools](https://github.com/CharlesHahn/DuIvyTools), and these features could potentially be part of DuIvyTools. However, if time permits, I hope that it can become more powerful than DuIvyTools in the future.


# Install

* Requirements

  * `Python >= 3.8`

* Install

  The module is installed by `pip` method:

  ```
  pip install gplt -i https://pypi.org/simple
  ```

  Please **ALWAYS** install Latest version.

  Update this module if you have installed:
  ```
  pip install gplt --upgrade -i https://pypi.org/simple
  ```

# Usage
## Plot xvg or xpm
```bash
gplt -f xxx.xvg
gplt -f xxx.xpm
```
## Convert dat to xpm
The `.dat` file was generated by gromacs tool, such as `densmap.dat`, `dssp.dat` (gmx dssp)
```
gplt -f xxx.dat
```
This command will generate a xxx.xpm file, then you can plot it by `gplt -f xxx.xpm`
